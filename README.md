LLMs_Rust_Links

Let's organize somehow links/resources to existing Rust solutions?

What about e.g. per each one file describing it and then script that would generate comparison table?

So let's start making pull requests and adding, one markdown per resource in llms/rust directory,
and later I will extract with some gpt3 script into RDF or CSV and then make comparison table.
How do you like this plan?
